 **ðŸ¤” What ? A virtual Lab ?**  
<p> Yes, Virtual Lab.. <br> The idea of a <b>Physics Virtual Lab</b> is somewhat like a traditional Physics Lab but its right on your screen and plus you can do much more things in a easy way. In a Virtual Lab You can pick certain elements available and apply available <b>Physical Properties</b> (like  <i>Force</i>,  <i>Friction</i> on that element and also You can customise the individual property . </p>
<br>
<p> For Example , You can pick a certain Element available like a Ball and apply certain Physical properties available like <i>Force Vector</i>, Set its magnitude and direction on that Element and see the respective result . </p>
<br>

**ðŸ˜®But What are we currently tried to make**
<p> We are on the mission to make all that labs that are the needs of a High school student. As a starting point We are currently trying to make a Vector lab, Where user can pick as many vectors he may need to work with and change the magntiude of them, direction of them and see what additon, subtraction , Dot-Product, Cross-Product actually means</p>

**Tech Stack Used :**

```
var TECH_STACK = {
ReactJS,
p5js : " as a animation library",
matterjs : "Our Phyics Engine",
//THat's all for now
}
